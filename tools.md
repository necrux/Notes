# Interesting Tools
Nothing special here, just a collection of tools I find interesting.

#### NETWORK
* *nethogs:* Lists processes by their network traffic.


#### IO
* *iotop:* Sorts processes by disk writes, and show how much and how frequently programs are writing to the disk.


#### LAPTOP
* *powertop:* Lists processes by their energy consume. It's a vital command when you're outside, somewhere you can't charge your laptop.
