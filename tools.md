# Interesting Tools
Nothing special here, just a collection of tools I find interesting.

#### Process Introspection
* *peekfd:* Peek at file descriptors of running processes.
* *gdb:* See what is going on "inside" another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.


#### NETWORK
* *nethogs:* Lists processes by their network traffic.


#### IO
* *iotop:* Sorts processes by disk writes, and show how much and how frequently programs are writing to the disk.


#### LAPTOP
* *powertop:* Lists processes by their energy consume. It's a vital command when you're outside, somewhere you can't charge your laptop.
